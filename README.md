## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Select a quiz subject
- Select a single answer from each question from a choice of four
- See an error message when trying to submit an answer without making a selection
- See if they have made a correct or incorrect choice when they submit an answer
- Move on to the next question after seeing the question result
- See a completed state with the score after the final question
- Play again to choose another subject
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the entire app only using their keyboard
- **Bonus**: Change the app's theme between light and dark

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### Future enhancements

- More componentized approach to the CSS
- I took a straightforward approach with one styles.css file for the entire app. This was probably fine for my initial thoughts on the project (building with vanilla JavaScript). But once I decided to make this a React solution, there are cleaner ways to go about it.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰');
};
```

### Continued development

Strictly speaking, this app did not need to be developed with React. In fact, this is the final project within the Frontend Masters JavaScript fundamentals path. But I've really come to enjoy working with React and didn't want to pass up an opportunity to keep experimenting and practicing. This was an extremely fun build and a project I'll certainly come back to and build upon in the future.

### Useful resources

- [clsx utility](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx) - A handy utility for handling className strings conditionally. I've used it in several projects now and now it's a go-to resource for me.

## Acknowledgments

There is no way to heap enough praise on [Bob Ziroll](https://scrimba.com/@bobziroll) and [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/). When it comes to learning React and some of the trickier parts of web development, there are no people I turn to more frequently.
