## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Select a quiz subject
- Select a single answer from each question from a choice of four
- See an error message when trying to submit an answer without making a selection
- See if they have made a correct or incorrect choice when they submit an answer
- Move on to the next question after seeing the question result
- See a completed state with the score after the final question
- Play again to choose another subject
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the entire app only using their keyboard
- **Bonus**: Change the app's theme between light and dark

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### Future enhancements

- More componentized approach to the CSS
- I took a straightforward approach with one styles.css file for the entire app. This was probably fine for my initial thoughts on the project (building with vanilla JavaScript). But once I decided to make this a React solution, there are cleaner ways to go about it.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰');
};
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

Strictly speaking, this app did not need to be developed with React. In fact, as part of the FEM JavaScript path, this is the final project to complete. But I've really come to enjoy working with React and didn't want to pass up an opportunity to keep experimenting and practicing. This was an extremely fun build and a project I'll certainly come back to and draw from in the future.

Somewhere between a beginner and intermediate dev when it comes to React and nearly all of that is thanks to the outstanding course materials from Bob Ziroll and Josh Comeau.
